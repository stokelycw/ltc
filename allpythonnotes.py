#   Recursion: When a function calls itself
#   CLASS: A template for creating objects.
#   Object: An encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
#       Get their variables and functions from classes
#   TRINARY OPERATIONS/CONDITIONALS
#   Algorithm: A way of solving a math/logic problem
#   Concatenation: gluing a cat's nose to another's tail
#   Loop: The code will run repeatedly
#       While Loops repeat while a statement is true (_)
#       For Loops repeat for members in a sequence (.)
#   IF: Gives a condition
#   ELIF: If previous conditions are false, try this one next.
#   ELSE: If all conditions are false, execute the following.
#   ==: Used in conditions; says two ints are equal; the same object
#   IS: Used in conditions; says two ints have the save numerical value
#   INPUT: Takes input from user interface
# Syntax
#   input("prompt")
#   else: enter, page break
#   elif: "#condition"
#   if: "#condition"
#   for x in range(start, stop, step)
#   for x in range(start, stop)
#   for x in range(stop)
#       task
#   while x < 100
#       x must be defined above and incremented, and while must be followed by a task
